This repository contains the smart contracts for the BLOC token sale.

The files that will be deployed are `contracts/BLOCToken.sol` and `contracts/BLOCCrowdsale.sol`. The rest of the files are sourced from OpenZeppelin to provide some libraries (such as SafeMath) and the core ERC20 token implementation.

ABI files are provided for anyone who wishes to interface with the contract.
